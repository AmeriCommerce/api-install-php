## Spark Pay Online Store - App Publishing & Installation
### Sample Application

All dependencies are included in this repository for ease of setup.

Update src/config.php with the Installation ID and Published Scope of the app you wish to run the sample for.

The easiest way to get up and running with this example is to use Docker, then it is as simple as `make` to get going. By default it is configured to forward your host's port 80 to the Docker VM, so the site will be accessible from `http://localhost`.
